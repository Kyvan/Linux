# Linux3

Script to set up bunch of services on RHEL based distros.

Running the script

	Add execute permission (if needed) to the script and then run it.
	When user input is needed, script will ask for it.
	All you need to do then, is type the information you have, and then press the "Enter" key.

	
NOTE:

	Script has been modified and has not been tested as of yet to ensure its functionality.
